addition of generating function

adding generating function means to add two sequences term by term forming another sequence 
which correspondce to another generating function formed by adding the two previous generating functions.

ex :- 
here are two sequences
<1,1,1,1,...> first one is infinite 1s.
<1,-1,1,-1,...> and another one is infinite sequence of alternating 1 and -1s.
from previous result we know that 
the sequence <1,1,1,1,...> corrosponds to the generating fn 1/(1-x)
and
the sequence <1,-1,1,-1,...> corrosponds to the generating fn 1/(1+x)

by adding these two sequence we get the sequence <2,0,2,0,2,....>
the generating fn corrosponding to this seq will be given by adding the two previous generating fn.
1/(1-x) + 1/(1+x) = 2/ (1-x^2). 
which is similar to the result obtained earlier.

now,

moving on to the next slide

addition rule
if 
there is a series 
<f0,f1,f2,f3,..> corrosponding to the generating fn F(x).
and another series 
<g0,g1,g2,g3,..> corrosponding to the generating fn G(x).
then the addition should be
<f0+g0, f1+g1, f2+g2, f3+g3,..> corrosponding to the generating fn F(x) +G(x).
meaning the terms with same indexes are added  to make a single term.
